  "product_overview": "Frontend Tablo is a modern Angular 16 based frontend application for the Tablókirály school photo book management system. It offers intuitive project management through features like a dashboard, sample photo galleries with advanced zoom, order data management, missing persons tracking, and schedule reminders, all wrapped in a responsive design supporting desktop and mobile devices.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Provide secure, password-less authentication methods including 6-digit code login and token-based share/admin preview login.",
    "Display comprehensive project dashboard with status, contact info, photo dates, and share functionality.",
    "Enable intuitive browsing of sample photos with a lightbox viewer and advanced zoom and pan capabilities.",
    "Manage order data presenting contact details, design preferences, AI-generated summaries, and PDF downloads.",
    "Track missing persons (students and teachers) with advanced search, filtering, and statistics.",
    "Offer responsive navigation with mobile-friendly features and accessibility support.",
    "Ensure robust state management and performance optimizations using Angular Signals, RxJS, and OnPush change detection.",
    "Implement thorough session validation and security via HTTP interceptors and auth guards."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Three distinct authentication methods: 6-digit code login, share token login, and one-time admin preview token login with secure token storage and session validation.",
    "Dashboard displaying project information, status badges with color coding, contact persons, photo date with schedule reminder dialog (including snooze functionality), and native share or copy to clipboard sharing options with toast notifications.",
    "Sample photo gallery showing thumbnails in a grid, opening in a full-screen lightbox with pinch, wheel, double-tap zoom, keyboard shortcuts, descriptive toggling, and navigation arrows.",
    "Order data section presenting detailed contact info, school and class details, counts, design preferences, AI summary and tags, PDF download, and order date.",
    "Lazy-loaded Missing Persons module listing students and teachers without photos with reactive search and filtering, grouped display, and real-time statistics.",
    "Responsive navbar that dynamically switches between desktop and mobile modes using ResizeObserver, featuring a mobile drawer with scroll lock and keyboard accessibility.",
    "Advanced Zoom Directive enabling smooth and performant zoom/pan interactions across devices with GPU acceleration and configurable max zoom.",
    "Toast notification system managing success, error, and info messages as reactive signals with auto-hide and animations.",
    "Clipboard service for copying emails, phones, and links with instant toast feedback.",
    "Schedule Reminder service managing visibility and snoozing tracking using LocalStorage."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User accesses the app and logs in using either a 6-digit code, share token, or preview token route. Token is validated and stored securely.",
    "Upon successful login, user is redirected to the Home Dashboard which displays project status, contacts, photo dates, and share options.",
    "User navigates to the Sample Photos gallery to browse thumbnails; clicking a thumbnail opens the Lightbox where they can zoom, pan, and navigate images using touch or keyboard controls.",
    "In Order Data, user views detailed order-related contacts, preferences, and AI-generated content, with options to download PDFs.",
    "If the project has missing persons, user navigates to the lazily-loaded Missing Persons page where they can search and filter students and teachers without photos.",
    "User accesses the responsive navbar to move between pages or log out; on mobile devices, the hamburger menu slides in with scroll locking and focus trapping.",
    "Schedule reminder dialogs appear contextually with snooze options stored to LocalStorage preventing repeated showing within snooze periods.",
    "Authentication state is monitored by guards and HTTP interceptors; on session expiry or unauthorized access, user is redirected to login."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "All three authentication methods successfully authenticate users and securely store tokens.",
    "Dashboard displays accurate project status, contacts, photo date, and schedule reminders that respect dismissal/snooze state.",
    "Sample photos gallery loads images correctly with responsive thumbnails and lightbox zoom/pan functions working on all supported devices and input methods.",
    "Order data page presents correct contact, school info, design preferences, AI summaries, and allows PDF download where applicable.",
    "Missing Persons module loads lazily and enables reactive filtering/search with correct grouping and statistics.",
    "Responsive navbar dynamically changes layout on window resize with no flicker and safely locks scroll on mobile menus.",
    "Zoom directive supports pinch, wheel, double-tap, drag, and keyboard controls with optimized performance and no memory leaks.",
    "Toasts appear promptly on copy actions and other triggers, displaying correct messages and dismissing after timeout.",
    "Session validation intercepts expired or invalid tokens promptly, clearing tokens and redirecting to login without errors.",
    "LocalStorage keys for schedule reminders are respected with correct persistence and daily limits on reminder display."
